ic-machine-size=Containerization machine dimensions
ic-stack-size-multiplier=Item stack size multiplier
ic-stacks-per-container=Stacks per container
ic-container-stack-size=Loaded container stack size
ic-belts-per-machine=Belts per machine
ic-cargo-wagon-inventory-multiplier=Cargo wagon inventory multiplier
ic-container-loss-chance=Container loss chance

[mod-setting-description]
ic-stack-size-multiplier=All items that can be loaded into containers will have their stack size multiplied by this number. This is applied before [font=default-semibold]Stacks per container[/font] is calculated.
ic-belts-per-machine=Container loading/unloading times are set so that this many belts can fully serve one machine of the same tier.
ic-cargo-wagon-inventory-multiplier=All cargo wagons (including from other mods) will have their inventory size multiplied by this number. To maintain equivalent balance to vanilla, this should be set to 1 / ([font=default-semibold]Loaded container stack size[/font] × [font=default-semibold]Stacks per container[/font]).
ic-container-loss-chance=The probability that a container will be lost when unloading. Only the container item itself is lost - the contents are always returned safely.
