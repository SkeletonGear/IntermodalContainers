Developed from [Deadlock's Crating Machine](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DeadlockCrating).

Intermediate resources can be loaded into containers.
Most things are configurable in mod settings.
Intermodal Containers automatically detects loadable resources, so should work with most mods. If a mod wants to override the autodetection or add a new tier of containerization machine, there is an API, documented [here](https://github.com/tburrows13/IntermodalContainers/blob/master/prototypes/public.lua).
